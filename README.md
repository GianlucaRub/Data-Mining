This repository contains the homework assignments for the course ID2222-Data Mining at KTH. Each folder contains a notebook with the experiments performed for the homework,  optionally a pdf report, and the code for a variety of Data Mining algorithms.

In particular, each homework comprises the following implementations:

| **Folder** |                    **Algorithms**                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       **Task Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

|    Homework 1  | Shingling, Min-hashing, Local Sensitive Hashing(LSH) |                                                                                                                                                        You are to implement the stages of finding textually similar documents based on Jaccard similarity using the shingling, minhashing, and locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) techniques and corresponding algorithms.                                                                                                                                                         |
|    Homework 2    |  A-priori algorithm, Association Rules generation  |                                                 Implement the A-Priori algorithm for finding frequent itemsets with support at least s in a dataset of sales transactions and develop and implement an algorithm for generating association rules between frequent itemsets discovered using the A-Priori algorithm in a dataset of sales transactions. The rules must have the support of at least s and confidence of at least c, where s and c are given as input parameters.                                                 |
|    Homework 3    |                        Triest                       |                                                                                                                                        You are to study and implement a streaming graph processing algorithm described in [ TRIÃˆST: Counting Local and Global Triangles in Fully-Dynamic Streams with Fixed Memory Size](http://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/papers/files/rfp0465-de-stefaniA.pdf)                                                                                                                                        |
|    Homework 4    |                 Spectral Clustering                 |                                                                       In this homework, you are to study, implement and test the spectral graph clustering algorithm described in the paper [On Spectral Clustering: Analysis and an algorithm](http://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/nips01-spectral.pdf) by Andrew Y. Ng, Michael I. Jordan, and Yair Weiss. You are to analyze two sample graphs using your implementation of the K-eigenvector algorithm.                                                                       |
|    Homework 5    |                        JaBeJa                       | This assignment aims to understand distributed graph partitioning using gossip-based peer-to-peer techniques, such as JaBeJa described in [F. Rahimian, et al., JA-BE-JA: A Distributed Algorithm for Balanced Graph Partitioning](https://canvas.kth.se/courses/36211/files/5772188/download?wrap=1) We provide a scaffolding source code for Ja-Be-Ja simulation for the one-host-one-node model. The simulator is written in Java. You need gnuplot, a portable command-line-driven graphing utility, to compile the results. |
